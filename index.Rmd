## Class Participation: {-}

I will frequently give readings or assignments for you to complete prior to the next class meeting. I expect you to fully engage the material: answer questions, pose questions, provide insightful observations. Keep in mind that quality is an important component in “participation.” Periodic cold calls will take place. I will also put students in the “hot seat” on occasion. In these class sessions, I may select a random group of students to lead us in the discussion and debate. Because the selection of participants will not be announced until class begins, everyone will be expected to prepare for the discussion. Reading the assigned chapters and articles are the best way to prepare for the discussion. If you have concerns about being called on in class, please see me to discuss. The purpose of the “hot seat” is not to stress or embarrass students, but to encourage students to actively engage the material.

## Phones {-}

**Phones are not allowed to be used in class without the instructor’s prior consent.** If you have a need of a phone during class please let me know before class. Unauthorized use of electronic devices may result in the lowering of the grade or dismissal from the class.  **I mean this.**

::: {.rmdimportant}

**The phone thing?  I mean this.**

:::


## Attendance {-}

You are expected to be regular and punctual in your class attendance. Students are responsible for all the material missed and homework assignments made. If class is missed, notes/homework should be obtained from another student. If I am more than 15 minutes late, class is considered cancelled. No more than 4 absences are allowed during a semester. Exceeding the absence policy may result in receiving an F for the course. The professors roll is the official roll and students not present when roll is taken will be counted as absent. If a student must miss an exam, she or he must work out an agreeable time with the instructor to take the test prior to the exam being given. If a student misses a test due to an emergency, the student must inform the instructor as soon as is possible. In special cases, the instructor may allow the student to take a make-up exam.


Additionally, it is the student’s responsibility to give the instructor one week’s notice prior to each instance where accommodation will be required.

## Honor Code and Plagiarism: {-}

All assignments/exams must be your own work. Any copying or use of unauthorized assistance will be treated as a violation of PC’s Honor Code. If you are unsure of what resources are allowed, please ask. Please note that all text longer than 7 words taken from ANY other source must be placed in quotations and cited. Also, summarizing ANY other source must also be cited. Using ANY other source and showing work to be your own is a violation of plagiarism and the honor code.

## Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Syllabus Statements {-}

Presbyterian College is committed to ensuring students from all faiths, identities and backgrounds have access to the services they need to thrive during their time learning in the classroom, living in our housing facilities, eating in the dining hall, or attending events on campus.

## Accessible Education {-}

To seek accommodations under the American Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, you must start the process yourself by completing the online form available on our website at https://www.presby.edu/academics/academic-resources-support/accommodations-for-disabilities/  and submitting appropriate documentation to accommodations@presby.edu. Accommodations will become effective once the structured exchange and documentation review processes are complete.

All forms are sent directly to the VP for JEDI and will be addressed according to institutional policies and procedures.

## Counseling and Health {-}

Recognizing physical and mental health are vitally important to academic success, we encourage students to take advantage of the counseling and health care services available on campus.

As a Presby First+ Advocate, I am committed to supporting first-generation college students. (Insert if applicable: I was a first-generation college student, meaning neither one of my parents had earned a bachelor’s degree, so I may have experienced some of the things you will face during your journey.) Know that you have lots of people wanting to see you thrive, so please use them as a resource. You can contact me anytime via email or stopping by my office. More information about the Presby First+ program is available on our website.
