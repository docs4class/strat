As a group of students studying crafting and implementing effective strategies, he has called upon you to advise him on how to proceed in light of the situation.

Please provide supporting analysis and persuasive argument for your recommended course of action (you must convince him to do what you suggest!) and you need to be specific about what to do and how to do it. You do not have to answer each of the following questions, but consider each of these as develop analysis and recommendations for your presentation.

You do not have to answer all of these questions but you may want to consider:

  What \textbf{KEY} problems does Robin Hood have? What issues \textbf{MOST} need to be addressed?
