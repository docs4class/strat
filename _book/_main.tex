\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist

\item
  Why might Fisker have have chosen his route -- what makes this easier for him? Are there dangers to this approach?
\item
  Which company has a superior strategic plan -- be critical, think carefully. Why?

  What do you think of Fisker's chances in the long run?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{robin-hood}{%
\chapter{Robin Hood}\label{robin-hood}}

Here are the specifics your Robin Hood presentations:

** We have ALREADY identified Robin Hood's challenges, so\ldots{}

Please work in a group of 2 to prepare a presentation (it does not have to be Slides, PowerPoint or Prezi) approximately 5-7 minutes in length as though you are Robin Hood's most trusted adviser.

As a group of students studying crafting and implementing effective strategies, he has called upon you to advise him on how to proceed in light of the situation.

Please provide supporting analysis and persuasive argument for your recommended course of action (you must convince him to do what you suggest!) and you need to be specific about what to do and how to do it. You do not have to answer each of the following questions, but consider each of these as develop analysis and recommendations for your presentation.

You do not have to answer all of these questions but you may want to consider:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What \textbf{KEY} problems does Robin Hood have? What issues \textbf{MOST} need to be addressed?
\item
  Do Robin Hood and the Merrymen need a new mission? new objectives? a new strategy?
\item
  What strategic options does Robin Hood have? Is continuing with the present strategy an option or is the present strategy obsolete?
\item
  Why not try to end the campaign by killing the Sheriff?
\item
  What are the pros and cons of accepting the offer of the barons to assist in securing King Richard's release from prison?
\item
  What action plan would you recommend to Robin? Should he implement a new tax? If so, how should it be structured?
\item
  How should Robin implement the recommended plan? What action steps will need to be taken to make the recommended strategy work successfully?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{can-you-say}{%
\chapter{Can You Say}\label{can-you-say}}

Based on the Harvard Business Review article: *Can you say what your strategy is? By David Collis and Michael Rukstadt, please be prepared to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Summarize briefly, what is the point of this article?\\
\item
  Be able to identify and explain the three core components of the strategy statement along with each of the \textbf{sub components}. You will need to know this!!!
\item
  Make sure you know what the examples in the article mean -- what about Red Lobster? What about Boeing?
\item
  If there's a chart, look at it. If there's a graph, understand it. These are all good -- and will be on your quiz.
\item
  Think of an organization of your choosing. How could you apply the ideas of this article to it? Could you write a strategy statement for that organization based on the principles of this article?
\end{enumerate}
