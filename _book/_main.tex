\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Class Participation:}

I will frequently give readings or assignments for you to complete prior to the next class meeting. I expect you to fully engage the material: answer questions, pose questions, provide insightful observations. Keep in mind that quality is an important component in ``participation.'' Periodic cold calls will take place. I will also put students in the ``hot seat'' on occasion. In these class sessions, I may select a random group of students to lead us in the discussion and debate. Because the selection of participants will not be announced until class begins, everyone will be expected to prepare for the discussion. Reading the assigned chapters and articles are the best way to prepare for the discussion. If you have concerns about being called on in class, please see me to discuss. The purpose of the ``hot seat'' is not to stress or embarrass students, but to encourage students to actively engage the material.

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\section*{Attendance}\label{attendance}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Attendance}

You are expected to be regular and punctual in your class attendance. Students are responsible for all the material missed and homework assignments made. If class is missed, notes/homework should be obtained from another student. If I am more than 15 minutes late, class is considered cancelled. No more than 4 absences are allowed during a semester. Exceeding the absence policy may result in receiving an F for the course. The professors roll is the official roll and students not present when roll is taken will be counted as absent. If a student must miss an exam, she or he must work out an agreeable time with the instructor to take the test prior to the exam being given. If a student misses a test due to an emergency, the student must inform the instructor as soon as is possible. In special cases, the instructor may allow the student to take a make-up exam.

Additionally, it is the student's responsibility to give the instructor one week's notice prior to each instance where accommodation will be required.

Please work in a group of 2 to prepare a presentation (it does not have to be Slides, PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.) approximately 5-7 minutes in length as though you are Robin Hood's most trusted adviser.

As a group of students studying crafting and implementing effective strategies, he has called upon you to advise him on how to proceed in light of the situation.

Please provide supporting analysis and persuasive argument for your recommended course of action (you must convince him to do what you suggest!) and you need to be specific about what to do and how to do it. You do not have to answer each of the following questions, but consider each of these as develop analysis and recommendations for your presentation.
